# üíñ Hot AI Girl - Your Virtual LLM-Powered Girlfriend

This project is a high-performance Telegram bot that utilizes modern LLMs (Large Language Models) to create maximally realistic and emotionally rich communication. The bot is designed as an AI girlfriend, always ready to listen, support, and inspire the user, strictly adhering to the established persona.

The project uses a **FastAPI + Webhooks** architecture for stable operation and an asynchronous stack for handling a large stream of messages.

* **Subscription System:** A flexible subscription system is built-in (days, weeks, months, years) for project monetization.
* **NowPayments Integration:** Fully automated cryptocurrency payment acceptance process (USDT/TRC20) via NowPayments.
* **Referral Program:** Users can invite friends and receive free subscription days (1 day for 3 referrals).
* **Limits and Anti-Spam:** Free message limits are provided (10 per day) along with an anti-spam protection system.
* **Asynchronous Stack:** Uses asyncio and httpx for fast and efficient processing of requests to LLM and payment gateways.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Running

### 1. Repository Cloning

```bash
git clone <YOUR_REPO_URL>
cd <PROJECT_FOLDER_NAME>
```

### 2. Environment Setup

Install required Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*(You need to create this file, containing: `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `python-telegram-bot`, `sqlalchemy`, `asyncpg`, `httpx`, `python-dotenv`)*

Create a `.env` file in the project root and fill it with the necessary variables:

```bash
# --- Telegram API ---
TELEGRAM_TOKEN="YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN"
TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_URL="https://YOUR_DOMAIN/webhook"
WEBHOOK_SECRET="RANDOM_SECRET_STRING"  # Used for Telegram verification

# --- LLM API (OpenRouter) ---
ROUTER_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENROUTER_API_KEY"

# --- Database (PostgreSQL) ---
DB_URL="postgresql+asyncpg://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<dbname>"

# --- NowPayments API ---
NOWPAYMENTS_API_KEY="YOUR_NOWPAYMENTS_API_KEY"
NOWPAYMENTS_API_URL="https://api.nowpayments.io/v1/invoice"
NOWPAYMENTS_WEBHOOK_URL="https://YOUR_DOMAIN/nowpayments-webhook"
SUCCESS_URL="https://t.me/BOT_USERNAME"
```

---

### 3. Database Initialization

When running FastAPI for the first time (`uvicorn`):

1. Ensure your PostgreSQL database is accessible via the specified `DB_URL`.
2. The script will automatically call `await init_db()`, creating the `users` table.

---

### 4. Running the Application

For local development, you can run the application using Uvicorn:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```
